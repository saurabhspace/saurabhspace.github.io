[{"content":"Hello, Iâ€™m Saurabh â€” a Physics enthusiast, educator, and tech tinkerer from the serene hills of Himachal Pradesh, India. I find joy in unraveling the mysteries of the universe and explaining them in clear, relatable, and meaningful ways.\nðŸŽ“ My Journey I hold an MSc in Physics and a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.). Over the years, Iâ€™ve nurtured a deep passion for teaching â€” making complex scientific ideas approachable, engaging, and enjoyable for everyone.\nðŸ’» Beyond the Chalkboard Outside the classroom, Iâ€™m a dedicated open-source and Linux explorer. Currently, Iâ€™m experimenting with Arch Linux, the Hyperland compositor, and minimalist desktop setups. Tinkering with tech is my way of blending logic, creativity, and freedom â€” much like Physics itself.\nWhen Iâ€™m not immersed in concepts or configuring my Linux environment, youâ€™ll likely find me traveling â€” whether itâ€™s exploring ancient temples, scenic landscapes, or discovering new places and cultures. I enjoy wandering through nature, historic sites, and lesser-known towns, collecting stories and experiences along the way.\nI also share my love for Physics on my YouTube channel, Vigyanarth, where I blend Hindi and English to explain science in a clear, natural, and approachable way.\nâœ¨ Why I Do This Whether itâ€™s breaking down a tough concept or tweaking a Linux config, I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge generously. Through my work, I aim to spark curiosity, empower others, and help people see the world through a slightly different, more curious lens.\n","date":"25 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"About Me","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello, Iâ€™m \u003cstrong\u003eSaurabh\u003c/strong\u003e â€” a Physics enthusiast, educator, and tech tinkerer from the serene hills of Himachal Pradesh, India.
